![dd logo](/Assets/DoorDash/dd.png)

## Overview
### Duration
3 weeks
### Tools
Figma, InVision, Miro, Google Forms, Google Sheets

### Background/Context
DoorDash is an online food ordering and food delivery platform based in America. According to Bloomberg Second Measure, DoorDash is leading the food delivery industry, making up 59% of US meal delivery sales as of May 2022. Similarweb Traffic Analytics also stated that DoorDash is ranked #1 in its category (Food & Drink > Restaurants & Delivery) in the US as of July 2022. With that said, I wanted to explore what DoorDash can do to maintain popularity among users and acquire more users.

### Problem
What are some ways DoorDash can offer higher quality service to its users to convert and retain users?

### Design Process
```
                                  Empathize => Define => Ideate => Delivery
```

## Empathize
I started off by surveying DoorDash users. I wanted to get a better sense of the current users and what kind of unpleasant experiences each of them might have had with the app.

### Survey
I conducted a survey on 11 DoorDash users to find out who they are, their experiences with food delivery apps, and their complaints about DoorDash.

### Insights
* 63.6% of participants favored DoorDash over other food delivery apps
* 63.6% of participants rated DoorDash a 4/5 star in regard to satisfaction
* 8 out of 11 participants have experienced issues using DoorDash (1 driver issue, 3 restaurant issues, and 4 app issues)

#### Survey Findings 1: DoorDash Satisfaction

#### Survey Findings 2: Experience issues using DoorDash

## Define
Now that I have an understanding of the customers and their experiences with DoorDash, I wanted to further investigate ways DoorDash's limitations. By doing this, I would be able to locate areas in the app that have been overlooked and could better accommodate its users. Essentially, this would help narrow down what I need to focus on when ideating.

### Competitive Analysis (competitive analysis image on the side)
I conducted a Competitive Analysis to compare other competitors' strengths & weaknesses. Rather than comparing DoorDash's direct competitors in the US, I selected food delivery apps in South Korea.

Based on prior secondary research, South Korea's food delivery systems/apps continue to thrive due to their convenience.

I wanted to examine what makes the delivery app in South Korea so successful over the years and apply them.

### Insights
* Baemin's advantage in leading Korea's food delivery app stems from dominating the food selections and having diverse options beyond food delivery
* Yogiyo's strength lies in the user experience; while the app is already equipped with a decent amount of restaurant options, its design is user-centered and easy to navigate
* Coupang Eats is simple; the app may not have as many options, but users who are not too particular and is not as tech-savvy, may find it easier to use

### Competitive Review - SWOT
I also used the SWOT method to evaluate DoorDash's Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats. This would also reinforce where DoorDash currently stands and where improvements could be made.

## Ideate
With solid awareness of improvements to be made, I began brainstorming and proposing new opportunities for the app.

### Storyboard
I wanted to explore the ways different users would interact with the DoorDash app with the improved features.

## Delivery
I've redesigned the DoorDash app by incorporating features that may be appealing to the users. I've taken into consideration that DoorDash users are generally satisfied with the app. Based on the research, leveraging DoorDash's position in being the leading food delivery company is the optimal way to continue growing.

Therefore, the goals for the prototypes are:
* Engage users to keep them coming back
* Having users rely on DoorDash as the main food delivery app

### Prototype 1 - Search Screen
I designed the search screen to include a section for ads/promos so that users can easily access deals when they are searching.
I added a section below for trending restaurants based on the set address. This can help users gauge what others are eating and narrow down what they might be craving.
At the bottom of the page, I added a search by tags section so that users can easily filter their interests when they search.

### Prototype 2 - Autoswitch Promo/Ad
I was inspired to design this after I saw the Korean delivery apps utilize this. I noticed that on DoorDash, users have to manually swipe left/right with their fingers to look at the available promos. This could lessen the labor for users who are already working to pick a restaurant and place an order.

### Prototype 3 - Precision Filter
I've implemented a pop-out window for extra filters so that users can simplify their search. Users are already straining with decision-making, and often, the abundant choices can be overwhelming. By applying precision filters, users can easily attain their ideal selections.

### Prototype 4 - DashPoints
In order to retain regular DoorDash users, I've integrated DashPoints which allows users to earn points when they place orders from participating restaurants. Depending on each restaurant, users can get free items from the menu or discounts.
Considering the possibility that there could be users who like to order from a restaurant often, this could be a way to have them return to DoorDash to place their orders.

### Prototype 5 - Gamification
I designed DashParty to gamify the process of ordering food. I've considered that users open the DoorDash app without knowing what they want to eat and sometimes they might not be in the mood to scroll through the feeds of restaurants. In order to ease the users with the labor load and add a touch of fun, this pop-out window will appear once the user opens the app. Users can choose to participate in the DashParty and try something new and also join for a chance to win $20.

## Conclusion
### Next Steps
If I had more time, I would like to do a follow-up survey to get users' feedback on the prototypes. Then, I would take the feedback and make necessary iterations and refine the UI aspect of the prototypes. I also want to dig deeper into the demographics of the participants from the survey. I got responses from participants from a diverse range of employment statuses. Considering that the project was on a food delivery system, I’m curious to discover any interesting connection between demographics (employment status, age, ethnicity, gender, location) and the use of tools/services convenient to people. 

### Reflection
I found analyzing the survey findings very interesting and exciting. I loved the aspect of turning the data into a tangible deliverable. I had a lot of fun delving into the creative aspect of my design skills for the prototypes. I also got a lot of practice putting myself in the users' shoes for this project. It was really fascinating to learn about the different ways users interact with the app, beyond my own personal assumptions. I hope to continue to uncover more findings as I empathize with and research users.
Thank your interest in my case study. Any constructive feedback is appreciated!
